- **Critical ecological issue**: rapid decline of coral reefs
    - ~50% decline in the last 3 decades
- Addressing coral decline requires **advanced monitoring and assaying techniques**
    - Traditional submersibles, divers, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) face **substantial limitations** with dexterity and deployment
- **Prior research** demonstrated the merit of a novel bio-inspired fish robot platform:
    - Open-loop swimming
    - Floating-body force application
- We seek to apply EECS 106A concepts of (sensing, planning, and actuation) to improve the ability of the robot to maneuver and manipulate in challenging aquatic environments
