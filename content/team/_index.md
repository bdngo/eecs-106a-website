# Stanley Wang

Stanley is currently a senior at UC Berkeley studying Mechanical Engineering.
He is passionate about bio-inspired robotics and controls, and currently works in the Embodied Dexterity Group with Professor Hannah Stuart. He has been working on FishBot as an independent research project since summer 2022 as part of the Jacobs Engineering Design Scholar Program. 

## Contribution

- Developed and debugged the hardware platform
- High-level conceptualization of motion planning and control strategies
- Extensive work in systems testing, development, and integration

# Bryan Ngo

Bryan is currently a senior at UC Berkeley studying electrical engineering and computer science.
He works in the SLICE Lab under Professor Bora Nikolíc on silicon compilers.
His interests include digital signal processing, computer architecture, and compilers.

## Contribution

- The wireless communication protocol between the ESP32 and the host computer
- The majority of the code driving the motor on the ESP32
- The basis for the target node motion planning
- Setting up the ROS network

# Shaikh Shamsuddin

Shaikh is currently a senior at UC Berkeley studying electrical engineering and computer science.
He is a researcher working for Dr. Waqas Khalid in the Nanotechnology laboratory.
Enjoys studying robotics, intelligent systems, and embedded-systems.
Plans on having a career in embedded systems and intelligent robots in the space industry while pursuing to become an astronaut.

## Contribution

- Worked on designing and the integration of the motion planning and control node for the ROS structure
- Incorporated the dynamics of the tail’s logistic curve in regards to how much the fish needs to move in a respective direction and build the overall ROS stack as a whole

# Khalid Durani

Khalid is currently a senior at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
He enjoys robotics and VLSI design.

## Contribution

- Worked on the motion planning and controller nodes for the FishBot.
- Aided in fixing hardware/electronics issues and testing the FishBot in a tank.

# Eric Yang

Eric is a senior undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley. His interests include integrated circuits for biomedical applications, controls, and robotics. He is currently advised by Prof. Mekhail Anwar in SWARM Lab, where he works on ultrasound power harvesting for an implantable imager chip used in cancer applications.

## Contribution

- Worked on CV and controller node implementations, including the OpenCV implementations for obstacle detection from images taken from the camera and initial controller designs.
- Helped with various tasks on the hardware side, including the mechanical aspects of the FishBot and dealing with challenges associated with hardware and electronics.
